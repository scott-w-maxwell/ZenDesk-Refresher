# ZenDeskFilterRefresh
This is a Chrome Extension for refreshing filters on ZenDesk.

I created this since the one created by [brandonstubbs](https://github.com/brandonstubbs/ZendeskRefresh) is no longer working.
I plan on maintaining this one, and plan to improve it as time progresses.

The next feature that will be added is the ability to customize the time interval, which is currently 10 seconds.
